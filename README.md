# first-godot

This is my first Godot project. I am following the [dodge the creeps tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game).

# Notes:
### Scenes vs. Nodes
A scene in Godot is any game object. A main menu, a player, a door, etc. Basically any object. A node is a child of a certain object. For example, a player's nodes might be their skin, their hitbox, their nametag, etc.
